# ABOUT PROJECT 
The Active Face Recognition Attendance System (AFRAS) is an advanced biometric solution designed to 
streamline and automate attendance tracking using face recognition technology. Active Face Recognition is an 
advanced biometric technology designed to identify or verify individuals by actively acquiring facial data under 
controlled or dynamic conditions. Unlike traditional passive face recognition systems, which rely on static 2D 
images captured from conventional cameras, AFR employs active sensing techniques such as structured light 
projection, 3D depth cameras, or infrared imaging to collect rich, multidimensional facial information.
