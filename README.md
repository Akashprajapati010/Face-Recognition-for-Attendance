Face recognition is a biometric technology that uses algorithms and machine learning to identify or verify a person by analyzing patterns based on the person's facial features. It involves detecting a human face in an image or video, extracting its unique features (such as eyes, nose, mouth, and their relative positions), and comparing them to a database of known faces to find a match.
